 <s2 title='Overview'>
  <p>
   Xerces contains many useful samples to help you get up-and-running
   with writing XML applications. Many of the sample programs are
   even useful as standalone programs to help in testing the validity
   of XML documents and/or debugging applications.
  </p>
  <p>
   The samples are organized either by API or by programming area in
   the following categories:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li><link idref='samples-dom'>DOM Samples</link></li>
   <li><link idref='samples-sax'>SAX Samples</link></li>
   <li><link idref='samples-socket'>Socket Samples</link></li>
   <li><link idref='samples-ui'>UI Samples</link></li>
   <li><link idref='samples-xni'>XNI Samples</link></li>
  </ul>
 </s2>
 <s2 title='Running the Samples'>
  <p>
   Running the sample applications requires that you have already
   installed the Java Development Kit (JDK) or Java Runtime
   Environment (JRE) on you computer and extracted the 
   &javaparsername; software.
  </p>
  <p>
   If you do not already have a JDK already on your computer download
   one from Sun&apos;s Java website: 
   <jump href="http://java.sun.com">http://java.sun.com</jump> or from 
   IBM&apos;s website
   <jump href="http://www.ibm.com/developer/java/">http://www.ibm.com/developer/java/</jump>.
   The sample applications described in the following pages support 
   Java 1.x (e.g. 1.1.8, etc) and/or Java 2 (e.g. 1.2.2, 1.3, etc).
   The UI samples are written using Swing and require Java 2 in order
   to run but all of the command line programs will run using Java 1.x.
  </p>
  <p>
   Command lines examples on the following pages use the Windows path
   separator &apos;;&apos; (semicolon) and directory separator 
   &apos;\&apos; (backslash). On UNIX, use the &apos;:&apos; (colon) 
   character to separate the JAR files in the classpath, and replace
   Windows directory separator &apos;\&apos; (backslash) with 
   &apos;/&apos; (forward slash).
